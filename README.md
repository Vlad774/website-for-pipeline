# CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, and AWS with GitHub 🚀
##  📌 Description
This project automates the deployment process using **Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, and GitHub Webhooks** on **AWS**.  
It ensures seamless **continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)**, making the process **faster, scalable, and reliable**.

## 🛠Technologies
- **Jenkins** → CI/CD automation
- **Ansible** → Configuration management & deployment
- **Docker** → Containerization for portability
- **GitHub Webhooks** → Automates pipeline triggering
- **AWS** → Cloud hosting for scalability
  
## 🔄 CI/CD Workflow
1️⃣ **GitHub Webhook triggers Jenkins** when a new commit is pushed.
2️⃣ **Jenkins pulls the latest code** and runs tests/builds.
3️⃣ **Ansible ensures infrastructure is configured** before deployment.
4️⃣ **Docker containerizes the application** for portability. 
5️⃣ **The final container is deployed on AWS**, ensuring high availability.
     
## ✨ Key Features
✔ **Automated builds & deployments** – No manual intervention needed.
✔ **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Using Ansible for server configuration.
✔ **Scalability** – The project is cloud-ready with AWS integration.
✔ **Webhook-triggered CI/CD** – Faster release cycles with automated GitHub commits.
